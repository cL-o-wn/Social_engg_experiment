  <h1>Social Engineering </h1>
  <br><br>

  <p>
    This is an article on Social Engineering .. One of the fields of cybersec that can never be guarded enough..
    Its about exploiting the weakest link : The humans.. The line below is precisely how it's done.. you get a Link you press on it and eventually you are screwed<br><br>

    Social engineering, in the context of information security, is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not
    concern the divulging of confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud
    scheme.
</p>
    It has also been defined as "any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests.
<br>
    <h4>Techniques and Terms</h4>
<p>
    All social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision-making known as cognitive biases.[6] These biases, sometimes called "bugs in the human hardware", are exploited in various combinations to create attack
    techniques, some of which are listed below. The attacks used in social engineering can be used to steal employees' confidential information. The most common type of social engineering happens over the phone. Other examples of social engineering
    attacks are criminals posing as exterminators, fire marshals and technicians to go unnoticed as they steal company secrets.
</p><p>
    One example of social engineering is an individual who walks into a building and posts an official-looking announcement to the company bulletin that says the number for the help desk has changed. So, when employees call for help the individual
    asks them for their passwords and IDs thereby gaining the ability to access the company's private information. Another example of social engineering would be that the hacker contacts the target on a social networking site and starts a
    conversation with the target. Gradually the hacker gains the trust of the target and then uses that trust to get access to sensitive information like password or bank account details.[7]

    <h4>Social engineering relies heavily on the 6 principles of influence established by Robert Cialdini. Cialdini's theory of influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity.
<br><br>
    Six Key Principles</h4>
    <p>
    <em>Reciprocity</em> – People tend to return a favor, thus the pervasiveness of free samples in marketing. In his conferences, he often uses the example of Ethiopia providing thousands of dollars in humanitarian aid to Mexico just after the 1985
    earthquake, despite Ethiopia suffering from a crippling famine and civil war at the time. Ethiopia had been reciprocating the diplomatic support Mexico provided when Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. The good cop/bad cop strategy is also based on
    this principle.<br><br>
    <em>Commitment and consistency</em> – If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment because they have stated that that idea or goal fits their self-image. Even if the original incentive or
    motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement. Cialdini notes Chinese brainwashing of American prisoners of war to rewrite their self-image and gain automatic unenforced compliance. Another
    example is marketers who make the user close popups by saying “I’ll sign up later” or "No thanks, I prefer not making money”.
<br><br>
    <em>Social proof</em> – People will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were missing. At one point
    this experiment was aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See conformity, and the Asch conformity experiments.
<br><br>

    <em>Authority</em> – People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts. Cialdini cites incidents such as the Milgram experiments in the early 1960s and the My Lai massacre.
<br><br>
    <em>Liking</em> – People are easily persuaded by other people whom they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of Tupperware in what might now be called viral marketing. People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the
    many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See physical attractiveness stereotype.
    <em>Scarcity</em> – Perceived scarcity will generate demand. For example, saying offers are available for a "limited time only" encourages sales.

<h4>
    Four Social Engineering Vectors
    </h4>
<br><br>
    <b>Vishing</b>
<br>
    Vishing, otherwise known as "voice phishing", is the criminal practice of using social engineering over a telephone system to gain access to private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is
    also employed by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to gather more detailed intelligence on a target organization.
<br><br>
    <b>Phishing</b>
<br>

    Phishing is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business—a bank, or credit card company—requesting "verification" of information and warning of
    some dire consequence if it is not provided. The e-mail usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate—with company logos and content—and has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN or a
    credit card number. For example, in 2003, there was a phishing scam in which users received emails supposedly from eBay claiming that the user's account was about to be suspended unless a link provided was clicked to update a credit card
    (information that the genuine eBay already had). By mimicking a legitimate organization's HTML code and logos, it is relatively simple to make a fake Website look authentic. The scam tricked some people into thinking that eBay was requiring them
    to update their account information by clicking on the link provided. By indiscriminately spamming extremely large groups of people, the "phisher" counted on gaining sensitive financial information from the small percentage (yet large number) of
    recipients who already have eBay accounts and also fall prey to the scam.
<br><br>
    <b>Smishing</b>
<br>
    The act of using SMS text messaging to lure victims into a specific course of action. Like phishing it can be clicking on a malicious link or divulging information.
<br><br>
    <b>Impersonation</b>
<br>
    Pretending or pretexting to be another person with the goal of gaining access physically to a system or building. Impersonation is used in the "SIM swap scam" fraud.</p>
